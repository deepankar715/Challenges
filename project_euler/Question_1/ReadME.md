 # Welcome to 50 days of Euler !

What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems
that will require more than just mathematicalinsights to solve. 
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming 
skills will be requiredto solve most problems.
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to 
delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.


 ### Today we are starting with our 1st Question of the lot


**Question 1 :**
**The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.**
**Find the sum of all the primes below two million.**
 
 
> Kindly go throught the rules before making the submission.
> Judging Criteria Should be kept in mind while making the solution.
> All the best to all the participants ! Enjoy this journey of Coding !!
